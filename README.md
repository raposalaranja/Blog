# Blog
The final project of this Back-End Bootcamp aimed to consolidate and apply the knowledge acquired in GitHub, HTML5, CSS3, Databases and the Django Framework.

It is suggested to have a virtual environment dedicated to the Django project, and one way to manage a virtual environment is venv, which is included in Python.
In the terminal, remember to navigate to where the project is. On Windows type: py -m venv blog.
Then, to activate the environment, don't forget to type: blog\Scripts\activate.bat
